The short linking will break I'm sure unless I can bug [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) to be bothered looking at the shortlink fields in my tables and making a secondary permalink.\n *  Sidenote: It'd be a good idea to get a handle on the permalink structure and having secondary links in micro.blog anyway IMO.\n- I need to see if there's a way to make a test blog and do the import first, fix what's broken, then switch over to the finished version by having a temp URL... Like preview and production at my job.\n- Oh, and [Bridgy](http://brid.gy) compatiblity things. Some of the crossposting is done on the backend by default I think, but how can I tweak some thangs... 🤔\n\nI can always jump around if things don't work out the way I want them anyway, right? \n\n(...plus I need to redo the VPS my blog is sitting on and `nixify` it.  )\n\n\n",
